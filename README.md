Exploratory Data Analysis of Titanic Dataset

Objective:
This project generates an automatic report for the Titanic dataset using the ydata-profiling library.

Implementation:

Libraries Used:

pandas: To manipulate and hold the Titanic dataset.
seaborn: For loading the Titanic dataset.
ydata-profiling: For generating a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) report.
Steps:

Load Dataset:
The Titanic dataset is loaded using Seaborn.

Generate EDA Report:
Using ProfileReport from ydata-profiling, a comprehensive EDA report is generated and saved as an HTML file.

Design Choices:

Using ydata-profiling provides an easy way to quickly explore a dataset, including insights into missing data, distributions, and correlations.
Challenges Faced:

There were no significant challenges, as ydata-profiling simplifies EDA.
